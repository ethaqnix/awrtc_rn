/**Avoid using this class directly whenever possible. Use ReactNativeWebRtcCall instead. 
 * ReactNativeMediaNetwork might be subject to frequent changes to keep up with changes
 * in all other platforms.  
 * 
 * IMediaNetwork implementation for the ReactNative. The class is mostly identical with the
 * C# version. Main goal is to have an interface that can easily be wrapped to other
 * programming languages and gives access to basic WebRTC features such as receiving
 * and sending audio and video + signaling via websockets. 
 * 
 * ReactNativeMediaNetwork can be used to stream a local audio and video track to a group of 
 * multiple peers and receive remote tracks. The handling of the peers itself
 * remains the same as WebRtcNetwork.
 * Local tracks are created after calling Configure. This will request access from the
 * user. After the user allowed access GetConfigurationState will return Configured.
 * Every incoming and outgoing peer that is established after this will receive
 * the local audio and video track. 
 * So far Configure can only be called once before any peers are connected.
 *
